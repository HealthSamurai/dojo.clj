   ;; Where: an indication of the context in which the error occurred. Presently

   ;; data type's schema.)

   ;; Constraint name: if the error was associated with a specific constraint,
   ;; the name of the constraint. Refer to fields listed above for the
   ;; associated table or domain. (For this purpose, indexes are treated as
   ;; constraints, even if they weren't created with constraint syntax.)
